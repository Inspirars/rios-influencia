        Rios-Influencia was founded out of a passion for  transforming patient care and bridging the critical gap in  healthcare management post-hospital discharge. Our  founder, Temitope Odetunde, experienced firsthand the  challenges healthcare professionals face during her time  in Community Health Services in the UK. She saw that  patients often relapsed due to inadequate post-discharge  care, a problem that deeply affected her both  professionally and personally.

        Determined to make a difference, Temitope transitioned to a  local community health service where she recognized the  urgent need for a system that effectively bridges hospital care  and continued home support.

        This realization led to the  creation of Rios-Influencia, a company born from her  unwavering commitment to training and empowering healthcare professionals to ensure patients receive the  comprehensive care they need for a full recovery.
